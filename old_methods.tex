\section{Training PriorVAE with MMD-based losses}\label{sec:priorvae+mmd}

\subsection{Qualitatively choosing a loss function}\label{subsec:qual}

As as a result, we are in need of some quantitative comparisons between these loss functions. 

\subsection{Quantitative approaches}\label{subsec:quant}
